The number of persons who are in need of blood is increasing in large number day by day. In order to 
help people who are in need of blood, my Online Blood Bank can be used effectively for getting the 
details of blood donors having the same blood group and in the same city. With the help of my Online 
Blood Bank people who are having the thought of donating blood get registered in the Online Blood 
Bank giving his/her total details. Blood donation is a vital part of worldwide healthcare. It relates to 
blood transfusion as a life-sustaining and life-saving procedure as well as a form of therapeutic 
phlebotomy as a primary medical intervention. Over one hundred million units of blood are donated 
each year throughout the world. The main goal of the Blood Bank and Donor Management System 
project is to monitor Blood Bank data, Blood cells, Bloodstock, and Donor List. It manages all the 
Blood Bank, Donor, and Bloodstock data. The project is entirely administrative and therefore 
access is guaranteed only to the administrator. The project's aim is to develop an application system 
to minimize the manual work for Blood Bank, Donor, and Blood Group management. It monitors 
all of the Blood Group information, Blood cells, Blood supply, and Donor list.
